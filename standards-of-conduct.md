# Standards of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The Perl Foundation believes our community should be truly open for
everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and
welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual
orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or country of origin.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior. We
invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, vendors, and other
participants to help us realize a safe and positive experience for everyone.

## 2. Scope

We expect all event participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees,
vendors, and other guests) to abide by this code of conduct in all interactions
between participants during the event.

## 3. Expected Behavior

* Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
* If you see something that causes you concern, alert the SOC committee.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

Possible unacceptable behaviors include:
* Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct
* Offensive verbal comments related to gender
* Gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability
* Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides)
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate and/or unwelcome physical contact and/or sexual attention.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior by attendees, organizers, venue staff, sponsors, or patrons
of TPF venues will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If anyone engages in unacceptable behavior, the SOC committee may take
any action they deem appropriate including expulsion without warning or compensation.

## 6. Reporting Incidents

If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being
subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a
[member of the SOC Committee](SOC-committee-members.md) as soon as possible.
You may also email [cat@perlfoundation.org](mailto:cat@perlfoundation.org)
or [use the following web form](...) to report an incident if you prefer.

## 7. Standard of Conduct Committee

Each event will establish a standards of conduct committee (SoC Committee) and
a chairperson for that committee. The point of contact for this committee will
be published on the event website. The SoC Committee will be responsible for
receiving and handling all incident reports. The SoC Committee is authorized
to establish any supplemental procedures necessary to fulfill their role,
provided that any such procedures are subject to approval by The Perl
Foundation.

If a member of this committee has a conflict of interest in handling a report
they are required to recuse themselves from the handling of that report. This
conflict of interest occurs when they are directly involved in an incident or
when they have a relationship with anyone involved in an incident, such as a
romantic, business, or family relationship.
